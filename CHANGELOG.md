## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Workload readiness no longer flaps on HPA scale-up.** Scalable workloads are now
  reported `Ready` when they are *serving*, not when they have reached their full
  desired replica count. Previously an HPA scale-up (e.g. 2→3) flipped the workload —
  and therefore the Application's `Ready` condition — to `InProgress`/degraded for the
  ~90s the new pod needed to pass its readiness probe, which monitoring read as a false
  incident. Applies to Deployment, StatefulSet, ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, and
  DaemonSet (node-join). Scaled-to-zero still resolves to `Ready`, and genuine failures
  (nothing available / `ReplicaFailure` / unavailable pods) still report `InProgress`.
  See [ADR-0003](doc/adr/0003-scale-up-readiness-flap.md) (Accepted). _(live on image tag

### Changed

- Test suites are envtest-only: removed the `UseExistingCluster` option from both the
  `controllers` and `e2e` suites and added a `127.0.0.1` host guard so no test can run
  against a real cluster / the current kubeconfig.

### Internal

- Repaired the `controllers` envtest suite so it runs: `CreateController` now applies a
  unique `.Named(name)` (previously the name argument was unused, causing a
  controller-name collision on the second spec); `StartTestManager` no longer asserts on
  the manager's shutdown error; and the stale ownerReference spec was rewritten to assert
  the controller does **not** mutate owner references (mutation was disabled in an earlier
  change).
- Added `controllers/status_test.go` with unit coverage for all five scalable workload
  kinds.
